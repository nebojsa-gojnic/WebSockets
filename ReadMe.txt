Nebojša Gojnić - WebSockets 
based on Dave Haig's WebSockets
Tls1 and Tls2 supported.  
Tls3 does not work via .net on Windows 10
You can put your site in resources of .net assembly, and yes, it works on Android!
For original project check this https://github.com/ninjasource/Ninja.WebSockets
but that one is actually about web sockets (not tested in my project)
